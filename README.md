# BBC Website Redesign – Hackathon Project

This project is a redesigned version of the BBC News website, created as part of the **Level Up Vibe Coding Hackathon** (May 2 – May 5). The goal was to modernize the BBC.com interface by addressing outdated UI elements, improving layout consistency, and implementing a responsive, accessible, and visually appealing design.

## 🔍 Project Overview

While the original BBC site is highly regarded for its content and credibility, the user interface has a simple and somewhat outdated structure, with inconsistent layouts across sections and limited use of modern design principles.

This project focuses on:
- Enhancing the user experience
- Standardizing design elements
- Introducing modern UI/UX patterns
- Building the project with reusable, modular components

## 🚀 Features Implemented

- ✅ **Fully Redesigned Home Page** with a clean and modern layout
- ✅ **Responsive Header and Navigation Bar**
- ✅ **Redesigned Slider Layout** to showcase section content
- ✅ **Dark Mode Toggle** for accessibility and preference
- ✅ **Modular Component-Based Design** using React
- ✅ **Card-Based News Box Layout**
- ✅ **Modern Login and Register Pages**
- ✅ **Improved Footer Layout**
- ✅ **Consistent Section Title Designs**
- ✅ **Smooth Animations and Transitions** for better interactivity
- ✅ **Responsive Navigation Menu** for all screen sizes
- ✅ **Focused Home page and Sports Section** and its sub-pages due to time constraints

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React.js
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS
- **Routing**: React Router DOM
- **Icons**: React Icons

## ♻️ Component Architecture

The project follows a **modular design** structure. Common UI elements like cards, buttons, section headers, forms, and layout blocks are built as reusable components to ensure scalability and maintainability.

## 📱 Responsive Design

The layout has been designed to adapt across desktop, tablet, and mobile screen sizes using Tailwind's responsive utility classes.

## 🎨 Design System

A consistent design system was maintained throughout the project using:
- Standardized color palette (including dark mode support)
- Typography hierarchy
- Uniform spacing and layout structure

## 🧩 Limitations

- Only the **Home page and Sports section** and its sub-pages were completed due to the limited timeframe
- Some backend functionality (like actual authentication) is not implemented — focus was on UI/UX
